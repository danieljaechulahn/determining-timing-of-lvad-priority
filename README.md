This is the repository for all analyses performed for the study entitled "Complications and Status Upgrades among Adult Heart Transplant Candidates with LVADs after the 2018 Allocation Policy Change: Waiting 6-8 Years for Status Escalation Is Too Long," in which we show that out of patients who had durable LVADs implanted between October 18, 2018 to May 31, 2025, the cumulative incidence of LVAD complications and status upgrades above status 4 is almost 40% by 6 years after implantation. We also showed that the predicted impact of the upcoming OPTN Heart Committee policy to escalate patients to statuses 3 and 2 after durable LVAD support for 6 and 8 years, respectively, is very low.
