This is the repository for all analyses performed for the study entitled "Complications and Status Upgrades among Adult Heart Transplant Candidates with LVADs after the 2018 Allocation Policy Change: Waiting 6-8 Years for Status Escalation Is Too Long," in which we show that out of patients who had durable LVADs implanted between October 18, 2018 to May 31, 2025, the cumulative incidence of LVAD complications and status upgrades above status 4 is >40% by 6 years after implantation. We also showed that the predicted impact of the upcoming OPTN Heart Committee policy to escalate patients to statuses 3 and 2 after durable LVAD support for 6 and 8 years, respectively, is very low. 

The files needed for this analysis are the Standard Analysis Files and all status justification files from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR), Q2 2025. There are three RMDs available. The first file that must be run is the data cleaning file, which creates the cohort of interest and merges all status justification files necessary to identify complications associated with LVADs. This file also includes code for Table 1 and Table 2 in the manuscript. The other two RMDs are needed to create the other figures in the manuscript.
